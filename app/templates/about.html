  <h4>Purpose</h4>
  <p>
    toxssin is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the
    process of exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It
    consists of an https server that works as an interpreter for the traffic
    generated by the malicious JavaScript payload that powers this tool
    (toxin.js). This project started as (and still is) a research-based creative
    endeavor to explore the exploitability depth that an XSS vulnerability may
    introduce by using vanilla JavaScript, trusted certificates and cheap
    tricks.

  <h4>Capabilities</h4>
  <p>
    By default, toxssin’s JavaScript poison automatically spreads across the
    elements and information of a webpage, abusing the XMLHttpRequest object to
    intercept:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>cookies (if HttpOnly not present),</li>
    <li>keystrokes (technically, an active keylogger),</li>
    <li>paste events,</li>
    <li>input change events,</li>
    <li>file selections,</li>
    <li>form submissions,</li>
    <li>
      server responses (to form submissions or clicking hyperlinks that target
      different pages and not internal parts of the same page),
    </li>
    <li>
      table data (static as well as updates on tables after a page has finished
      loading).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most importantly, toxssin:</p>
  <ul class="">
    <li>
      attempts to create XSS persistence while the user browses the website by
      intercepting http requests & responses and re-writing the document,
      creating the illusion of navigating when actually the document’s location
      never changes,
    </li>
    <li>
      supports custom JS script execution against sessions (after a browser gets
      hooked, you can run custom JS scripts against it),
    </li>
    <li>automatically logs every session.</li>
  </ul>
